## What Is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a CLI tool for defining and running **multi‚Äëcontainer Docker applications**. You describe your application‚Äôs services, networks, and volumes in a single `docker-compose.yml` file, then spin everything up (or down) in one command.

---

## Why Use Docker Compose?

- **Simplicity**: Orchestrate multiple services with one file and a few commands.  
- **Reproducibility**: Every developer or CI environment uses the exact same configuration.  
- **Isolation & Modularity**: Each service runs in its own container, isolating dependencies.  
- **Declarative Infrastructure**: ‚ÄúInfrastructure as code‚Äù‚Äîversion‚Äëcontrol your deployment setup.

## Core Concepts & Terminology

| Term            | Definition                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Service**     | A container definition. E.g., `web`, `db`, `cache`.                         |
| **Image**       | Read‚Äëonly template used to build containers.                                |
| **Container**   | A running instance of an image.                                             |
| **Volume**      | Persistent filesystem storage managed by Docker.                            |
| **Network**     | Virtual network connecting containers.                                      |
| **Depends_on**  | Specifies start‚Äëup order between services.                                  |
| **Environment** | Environment variables passed into a container.                              |

## Common Commands & Explanations

| Command                             | Explanation                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker compose up`                 | Build (if needed) & start all services; attaches to logs.                             |
| `docker compose up -d`              | Run in **detached** (background) mode; containers keep running after terminal closes. |
| `docker compose down`               | Stop and remove containers, networks, and default volumes.                            |
| `docker compose stop`               | Stop services without removing containers.                                            |
| `docker compose start`              | Start services that were previously stopped.                                          |
| `docker compose restart`            | Stop & start services‚Äîuseful after config changes.                                    |
| `docker compose build`              | Build or rebuild service images (honors `build:` keys).                               |
| `docker compose ps`                 | List running containers and status for each service.                                  |
| `docker compose logs`               | View logs across all services (or specify service: `logs web`).                       |
| `docker compose exec <svc> <cmd>`   | Run a command inside a running service (e.g., `exec web sh` to drop into shell).      |
| `docker compose run --rm <svc> CMD` | Run a one‚Äëoff command in a new container and remove it after exit.                    |
| `docker compose pull`               | Pull service images from registry without starting containers.                        |
| `docker compose config`             | Validate & view the fully expanded Compose file (merges `.env`, interpolations).      |

## Advanced Features

* **`healthcheck:`**
  Monitor service health and control start‚Äëup order more robustly.

  ```yaml
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5000/health"]
    interval: 30s
    retries: 3
  ```

* **`profiles:`**
  Group optional services. E.g., only start `redis` in `dev` profile.

  ```yaml
  profiles: ["dev"]
  ```

* **`secrets:`**
  Securely manage sensitive data (passwords, keys) without baking them into images.

* **`extends:`**
  Reuse or inherit settings from another Compose file or service block.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Keep services small & focused**: One process per container.
2. **Use named volumes** for persistent data.
3. **Avoid `latest` tags** in production‚Äîpin to specific versions.
4. **Leverage `.env`** for environment‚Äëspecific configuration.
5. **Healthchecks** ensure orchestrator knows if a container is truly ready.
6. **Version control** your Compose file alongside application code.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **‚ÄúCannot connect to Docker daemon‚Äù**

  * Ensure Docker Engine/Daemon is running.
  * On Windows: Start Docker Desktop; verify WSL2 backend if using Linux containers.

* **Obsolete `version:` warning**

  * Remove the `version:` line; modern Compose infers latest schema.

* **Networking issues between containers**

  * Ensure services share the same network block.
  * Use service names (DNS) to reference containers (e.g., `redis:6379`).

* **Permission errors on mounted volumes**

  * Check host folder permissions; consider using Docker-managed volumes instead.
